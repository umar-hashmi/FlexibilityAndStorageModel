# Initialization and Setup:

The script starts with clearing the workspace, closing all figures, and clearing the command window to ensure a fresh environment.
Data is loaded from a .mat file, and relevant parameters are initialized.

# Precomputations:

Several constants and matrices are precomputed to avoid redundancy within the loop.

# Matrix Construction:

Matrices for the linear programming problem (A_buy, A_sell, A_minus, A_zero, and K_mat) are constructed and modified according to the constraints.

# Main Loop:

For each iteration, the flexibility bounds are adjusted, and the linear programming problem is formulated and solved using linprog.
The cost and profit are calculated based on the results of the optimization.

# Results Collection and Display:

Results are collected into an array and displayed after the loop execution.
