# Walking through code
## Initialization and Setup:

The script starts with clearing the workspace, closing all figures, and clearing the command window to ensure a fresh environment.
Data is loaded from a .mat file, and relevant parameters are initialized.

## Precomputations:

Several constants and matrices are precomputed to avoid redundancy within the loop.

## Matrix Construction:

Matrices for the linear programming problem (A_buy, A_sell, A_minus, A_zero, and K_mat) are constructed and modified according to the constraints.

## Main Loop:

For each iteration, the flexibility bounds are adjusted, and the linear programming problem is formulated and solved using linprog.
The cost and profit are calculated based on the results of the optimization.

## Results Collection and Display:

Results are collected into an array and displayed after the loop execution.



# The proposed battery and flexibility model
Energy storage and flexibility model with ramp rate constraint: we improve the flexibility model by considering the ramp rate constraint. The flexibility model also includes a desired time window of operation and a deadline constraint ensures that the energy consumed is
temporally optimized with this time window. The battery models also consider ramp and capacity constraints. The proposed model is linear and can be efficiently solved using off-the-shelf solvers. The run-time for 1000 Monte Carlo (MC) simulation days with 96 time steps for each MC
scenario takes less than 30 seconds. Due to its computational efficiency, the proposed models are suitable for (near) real-time operation
